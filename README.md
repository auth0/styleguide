## Development

**Node version: 6.9.x NPM version: 3.10.x**

We use [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to manage the different packages. You will need to [install it](https://lernajs.io/#getting-started) to run the following commands.

Before start working on any packages run:

```
npm install
lerna bootstrap
```

This command will install all the dependencies of each package, symlink the packages that are dependencies of each other and `npm prepublish` all the bootstrapped packages. For more information check the [Lerna repo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#bootstrap).

For more information on how to run each package check the specific README.
